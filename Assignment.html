	Cats are cute and cuddly but this is not the only reason I love them. 
	</p>
	<h3>
	They are independent
	</h3>
	<p> 
	They do not have to be walked everyday and are litter box trained. 
	</p>
	<h6>
	They have airplane ears when they are ready to attack.
	</h6>
	<p> 
	The above requires no additional explanation.
